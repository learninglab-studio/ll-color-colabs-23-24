The dancer is in the en pointe position, standing on the tips of her ballet shoes. Her tutu is depicted as if it's made of a smoke-like substance, flowing ethereally around her body, enhancing the impression of delicate movement. The skeleton is detailed, showing the skull, spine, rib cage, and the bones of the arms and legs clearly. The image is monochromatic, with varying shades of blue and white, set against a dark background. The overall effect is both haunting and beautiful, blending the grace of ballet with an otherworldly, spectral quality.\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Check the `isURL` box to indicate if the image format is a URL or an uploaded file.\n","write the prompt to ask about the image under the `prompt` variable.\n","Input either the image url or image path under the `image` variable"],"metadata":{"id":"cZQor4QWMKZn"}}]}
