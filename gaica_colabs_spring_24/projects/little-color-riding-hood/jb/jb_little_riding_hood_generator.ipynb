The user input is a photo, to which the generator matches with the closest pantone color. The name of the pantone color will be in the title of the story, namely \"Little [color] Riding Hood\". A text generator API writes a storyline based on a prompt, and then a DALL-E API is used to generates a series of images based on the plot.
